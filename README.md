# Comments

Hoping to save myself some points here. In doing this assignment, and the previous one, I couldn't figure out how to create branches based off a tag. I think I incorrectly assumed that creating a tag and then creating a branch would work. I've since found a site with information that makes me think I should've created the new branches with `git branch <newbranch> v0.1>`. If that's correct, please let me know. I realized all of this while going over the deductions, but with a completed project full of branches and commits, I wasn't sure how to go back and fix that without starting over.
